# How to Build Laravel Packages

This was intended to be an updated repo of the [@pusher](http://github.com/pusher)'s tutorial [How to Build Laravel Packages](https://pusher.com/tutorials/build-laravel-packages) but **THERE'S A MISSING LAST PART**.

Since I was only doing this to test [laravel-packager](https://github.com/Jeroen-G/laravel-packager) but, got curious about Pusher, I went 'till the final. It was all working good, except the pusher notification. As I've started with the newer versions of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), **that was expected**. The tutorial uses `pusher-http-laravel`, the newer versions uses `pusher-php-server`. And I didn't find tha Facade trigger on the new one to fix the post route.

As I don't have time to fix this post route now, I'll give up.

Shit happens! :poop:
